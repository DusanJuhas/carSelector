"""Tests for BmwParser on the real combined price list (downloaded
2026-08-29 from bmw.cz, effective 1 July 2026 — see scraper/tests/
fixtures/bmw_cenik.pdf). Prices are transcribed by hand from the PDF text,
so it can always be verified that the extraction matches the source —
same discipline as test_kia_parser.py.

The fixture covers BMW's entire current lineup (29 model sections across
6 pages) — these tests check a representative cross-section (combustion,
electric, plug-in hybrid, a section split across two pages, and a section
sharing its page with an M-performance chassis annotation) rather than
every row."""
