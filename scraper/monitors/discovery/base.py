"""Common interface for finding links to PDF price lists. Same principle as
`parsers/base.py`: both the structure and the number of pages that need to
be fetched differ from brand to brand, hence per-brand implementations
instead of one universal HTML parser — see the `pdf_pattern` field in
`config/sources.yaml`.

Making the HTTP request is deliberately part of `discover` (not done
upfront in `SourceMonitor` and passed in as `html`): Škoda has a single
listing page with all models (one GET), but VW has a separate price list
page per model (`source.models` GETs) — because the discoverer also
controls the fetch, each brand can have a different strategy without
`SourceMonitor` needing to change.

A new brand = a new file in this directory + registration in
`registry.py`, nothing else needs to change.
