"""Discoverer for mgmotor-czech.cz.

Unlike Opel/Peugeot, MG's own site has no bot-blocking at all - verified
2026-09-13, `requests` gets a plain 200 for the homepage and every PDF
link on it. The homepage itself (not a separate "ceníky" page - there
isn't one) links every current model's own "Ceník" PDF directly, same
"single listing page" shape as Škoda/BMW/Dacia's own discoverers, just
with the price-list links scattered across several per-model sections of
one page rather than gathered under one heading.

`_FILENAME_MODELS` maps each PDF's own basename (the href, with or
without a leading "/", trimmed to its last path segment - the homepage
prints the same MG3 link both ways in different sections, verified
2026-09-13) to the model name `MgParser`'s own cover-page extraction
would produce for that document, so `source.models` can filter on the
same names the parser uses without the discoverer having to open every
PDF itself just to find out what's inside."""
