"""Discoverer for peugeot.cz.

Like Opel, peugeot.cz's own listing page
(https://www.peugeot.cz/uzitecne-odkazy/ceniky.html) sits behind an
Akamai WAF that blocks `requests` at the TLS/network-fingerprint level,
not just on missing headers - verified 2026-09-13 that even a complete,
realistic browser header set (the same one `pdf_downloader.py` uses for
Opel) still gets rejected, both for that page and the bare homepage.

Unlike Opel, though, the ACTUAL price-list PDFs aren't on peugeot.cz at
all - every "Ceník a tech. data" link points at peugeot.ecpaper.cz, a
separate flipbook-viewer site that embeds the real PDF (hosted on Azure
Blob Storage) in its own page. That viewer site has none of peugeot.cz's
own WAF - verified `requests` gets a plain 200 for both the viewer page
and the underlying blob URL - so `_MODEL_PAGES` hardcodes each model's own
STABLE ecpaper.cz viewer-page URL (found the same manual way Opel's own
PDF URLs were - a human visiting the blocked listing page in a real
browser), and `discover` does one `requests` GET per model to resolve
today's actual PDF URL out of that page's own HTML. This is less
stale-prone than Opel's fully-hardcoded approach: the viewer-page URLs
stay put across a routine price-list refresh (only the PDF asset
underneath changes), so only a genuine site restructuring - a new model
year's own new slug, e.g. "208-new" becoming "208-my27" - would need this
module updated by hand; a plain quarterly price refresh doesn't.

Peugeot's current CZ personal-car lineup has 9 nameplates with their own
"Ceník a tech. data" link on that listing page - `_MODEL_PAGES` covers
7 of them. The plain "308" hatchback's own link is dead (404s back to
ecpaper.cz's generic customer/catalogs page, both via `requests` and a
real browser) - only "308 SW" (the wagon) has a working document, so
plain "308" is omitted, same convention as CUPRA's own stock-only/
not-yet-on-sale omissions. Traveller's own document uses a completely
different structure PeugeotParser doesn't read yet (see that module's own
docstring), so it's omitted here too rather than left as a document this
source would find but the parser can't use. Expert/Partner/Boxer
commercial vehicles were never in `_MODEL_PAGES` to begin with, same
"personal cars only" convention as every other brand here."""
