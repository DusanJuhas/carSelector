"""Discoverer for toyota.cz price lists.

The HTML listing page (toyota.cz/koupe-a-nabidky/ceniky) renders nothing
server-side — it's a client-side widget that itself calls a JSON API. The
real endpoint (found in the page's inline script, `PDF_API`/`B` variable)
is `https://pdf.sites.toyota.cz/api/models-documents`, which returns
groups of models, each with a `documents` list carrying the actual
`mainLink` download URL. (A second endpoint, `.../api/documents-model`,
looked similar at first but only returns filename metadata, no URLs —
not used here.)

Real-world messiness handled here, all verified against the live API on
2026-08-13:

- Every model has MANY documents (this year's + last year's price list,
  a "akce"/"limited_edition" promotional variant, catalogs, accessory
  price lists, ...) rather than one obvious "current" one.
  `_current_price_list` keeps only documents whose label/link doesn't
  contain "akce"/"limited_edition" (the promotional variants — same
  principle as VolkswagenDiscoverer excluding "Akční ceník modelu ..."),
  then picks the highest `id` (Toyota's API assigns ids in creation
  order, so the highest id among the remaining candidates is the current
  one — more robust than parsing a year out of the filename).
- A redesigned model can appear as TWO separate model entries: an old
  one under the plain name (e.g. "RAV4", "Yaris Cross") whose price list
  is stale, and a new one under a "Nová"/"Nový"/"Nové"-prefixed name
  (e.g. "Nová RAV4", "Nový Yaris Cross") that's actually current. Both
  collide on the same name once the marketing prefix is stripped —
  `_pick_current_generation` keeps the prefixed (current-generation) one
  on collision.
- Corolla is sold as three body styles (Sedan/Hatchback/Touring Sports),
  each a genuinely separate document — like Kia's Sportage ICE/HEV split,
  `source.models` has a single "Corolla" entry but this returns all three
  under distinct keys. "Corolla Cross" is deliberately NOT included here
  even though its name also starts with "Corolla" — Toyota positions it
  as its own (crossover) nameplate, not a Corolla body style.
