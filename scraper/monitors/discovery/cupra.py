"""Discoverer for cupraofficial.cz.

Like Škoda/BMW/Dacia, a single listing page
(https://www.cupraofficial.cz/nabidky/ceniky-a-katalogy, "Ceníky a
katalogy") lists every model's price list - verified 2026-09-12, server-
rendered (`requests` sees the same markup a browser does, no Playwright
needed). Unlike any of those three, the actual "Stáhnout"-equivalent link
isn't a plain `<a href="...pdf">` at all: `href="#"` (a client-side
download handler), with the real path only present in a
`data-gtm-element-url` attribute (no ".pdf" suffix, but the server returns
`Content-Type: application/pdf` regardless - verified by fetching it
directly) - and the MODEL itself is identified by a sibling
`data-gtm-event="Ceniky_a_katalogy-Stahnout_cenik_<Slug>"` attribute on the
same `<a>`, not by anchor text or nearby headings (both of which just read
"Ceník" for every model alike). `_CENIK_LINK_RE` captures both attributes
from one tag in a single pass.

The page also lists a "Katalogy CUPRA" section (brochures, own
`data-gtm-event` prefix "Ceniky_a_katalogy-Stahnout_katalog_...") and a
"CUPRA CONNECT" one (infotainment manuals) - `_CENIK_LINK_RE` only matches
the "Stahnout_cenik_" prefix, so neither is picked up.

CUPRA's full current CZ lineup is 8 nameplates, but only 6 have a price
list of their own here: Ateca is sold as stock-only (no "CENÍK" link on
this page for it, only a "Katalog" - matches the homepage's own "SKLADOVÉ
VOZY" label instead of a price link) and Tavascan has no price-list link
yet either (too new - CZ sales hadn't started as of this verification
date). `_SLUG_MODELS` covers exactly the 6 that do."""
