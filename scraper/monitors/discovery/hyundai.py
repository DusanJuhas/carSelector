"""Discoverer for hyundai.com/cz.

Unlike Škoda/Kia (one shared listing page) and like Volkswagen, Hyundai has
a separate page per model at `/cz/modely/<slug>.html` — but unlike VW, the
slug can't be derived from the model name at all (marketing prefixes vary:
"nova-i20", "nova-i30", "nova-kona", "novy-tucson", "nove-santa-fe"), so
`_SLUG_OVERRIDES` is required for every model, not just the exceptions.
The page is server-rendered; the price-list link is a plain `<a
class="downloadlist__link" href="...">` with the href read directly
(2026-08-28), no JSON attribute parsing needed. The link's OWN text
(`a.get_text()`) isn't usable for matching, though - it concatenates every
descendant text node, including the file-type/size badge that follows the
title in the DOM ("... l Ceník PDF 1.16 MB download_new"); the title alone
is a dedicated `<span class="downloadlist__main-text">` inside the anchor.

A model page lists several "Ceník" (price list) documents for different
purposes, not just one:
- "Akční ceník" (campaign/promotional price list) and "Ceník příslušenství"
  (accessories) are different document TYPES, not the current price list —
  skipped by requiring the link text to end with exactly "l Ceník" (the
  promotional one ends with "l Akční ceník", the accessories one with
  "l Ceník příslušenství").
- The remaining "l Ceník" links differ by model year, e.g. "TUCSON MR27
  (pouze pro nové objednávky do výroby) l Ceník" (current) vs "TUCSON MR26
  (skladové vozy) l Ceník" (previous year, stock only) — `_model_year` picks
  the highest "MRxx" found (a range like "MR26-27" counts as the second
  number), same principle as Kia's "Ceník" -> "Ceník skladových vozidel"
  fallback: prefer the current one.
- Tucson additionally splits into two entirely separate documents by
  powertrain line ("TUCSON MR27 ... l Ceník" for ICE/MHEV, "TUCSON Hybrid
  a Plug-in MR27 ... l Ceník" for HEV/PHEV) — both are discovered, the
  Hybrid one returned under a distinct "<model> Hybrid" key, same principle
  as Kia's "Sportage"/"Sportage HEV" split (see monitors/discovery/kia.py).
  Santa Fe's price list is HEV/PHEV-only but its link text has no "Hybrid"
  marker, so it's discovered as a single plain document — HyundaiParser
  classifies HEV vs PHEV per row regardless (same as VW's mixed-powertrain
  documents), so this split only matters when it's genuinely two separate
  PDFs to fetch.

Some models (e.g. Bayon) currently have no discoverable "l Ceník" link at
all (verified 2026-08-28) — `discover` simply omits them, same as VW's
Touareg precedent.
