"""Discoverer for bmw.cz.

Like Škoda, and unlike every other brand added after it, this is about as
simple as discovery gets: `https://www.bmw.cz/cs/topics/details/katalogy-
ceniky-ke-stazeni.html` ("Katalogy a ceníky ke stažení") is server-rendered
with the combined "Ceník základních modelů" ("Price list of base models" -
covers the entire current lineup, see parsers/bmw.py) as a plain `<a
href="...pdf">` link, no JSON-in-a-script-tag or client-rendered widget to
work around (verified 2026-08-29 - a previous note in config/sources.yaml
recorded this page as unreachable from this environment; that's no longer
the case). The href is a relative, already-URL-encoded path
(`/content/dam/bmw/...pdf`), so only the domain needs prefixing - no
`urllib.parse.quote` step like Mercedes-Benz's needs.

The page also links a couple of older, narrower price lists further down
(an M3/M4-only one from 2023, seemingly superseded by the combined one
having its own current M3/M4 rows) - `_PRICE_LIST_RE` only matches an href
whose filename contains "Cenik" (this brand's own spelling, capital C) to
avoid picking one of those up instead."""
