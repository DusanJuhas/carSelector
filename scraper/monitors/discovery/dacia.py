"""Discoverer for dacia.cz.

Like Škoda/BMW, a single listing page (https://www.dacia.cz/ceniky-a-
brozury.html, "Ceníky, brožury, pdf") is server-rendered with each model's
own "Ceník" link as a plain `<a href="...pdf">` — verified 2026-09-07.
Unlike either of those, the href points at Renault Group's shared asset CDN
(cdn.group.renault.com), not dacia.cz itself, and the filename embeds the
model as a slug (`pricelists/<slug>-cenik.pdf.asset.pdf/<hash>.pdf`, e.g.
".../pricelists/sandero-stepway-cenik.pdf.asset.pdf/09902ceec3.pdf") -
`_SLUG_MODELS` maps each slug back to its canonical model name (can't be
derived mechanically - the slug replaces the model's own space with a
hyphen, and there's no other reliable signal on the page to read the name
from, see parsers/dacia.py's own note on the page's inconsistent heading
casing).

The page currently lists 6 models (Spring, Sandero, Sandero Stepway,
Jogger, Duster, Bigster) - the full current CZ lineup (Logan/Lodgy et al.
are no longer sold new, so `sources.yaml`'s `models` list only names these
six). Each model has exactly one "Ceník" link (no separate trim/powertrain
documents like Kia's Sportage, no stock/promo duplicate like Mazda's), so,
unlike Mazda's caption-scoped search, one page-wide regex sweep is enough -
order on the page doesn't matter since the slug identifies the model
directly."""
