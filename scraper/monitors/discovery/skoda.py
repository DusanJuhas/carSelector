"""Discoverer for skoda-auto.cz.

Škoda renders links as `<a href=".../_doc/<uuid>">Model - Ceník</a>`
("Ceník" = "Price list"; instead of a regular space around the dash it's
often `&nbsp;`, and sometimes the same document is linked by multiple
anchor tags — one with text, one empty/image-only). BeautifulSoup
handles both the entities and the duplicates without needing a custom
regex on the raw HTML (that was tried first and was unreliable).
