"""Discoverer for opel.cz.

Unlike every other brand here, this one can't actually discover anything
automatically: opel.cz's listing page
(https://www.opel.cz/nastroje/katalogy-a-ceniky.html) sits behind an
Akamai WAF that blocks `requests` at the TLS/network-fingerprint level,
not just on missing headers - verified 2026-09-12 that even a complete,
realistic browser header set (the same one that DOES get through for the
PDF endpoints themselves, see `pdf_downloader.py`'s own `_BROWSER_HEADERS`)
still gets rejected for the listing page and even the bare homepage. Only
a real browser engine (e.g. Playwright) could render that page, which is
out of scope here (see `pdf_downloader.py`'s own docstring and this
brand's sources.yaml entry for the same note).

So `_DOCUMENT_URLS` hardcodes the current URLs directly instead of finding
them on a page - the same 11 URLs `scripts/download_opel_pricelists.py`
uses to seed this brand's own test fixtures (that script exists for
exactly this reason: these URLs can't be found programmatically, so a
human has to). Each of Opel's 6 personal-car nameplates has its own
combustion/hybrid document (Astra has two - "HB" hatchback and "ST"
Sports Tourer wagon, sharing one Astra Electric document between them
instead of splitting it too) plus its own separate all-electric document
- 11 keys total, one per real document (not one per real-world model:
Astra alone needs 3 different keys/URLs to reach all of its own price
data) - see OpelParser's own module docstring for why the *parsed*
`model` field then normalizes 3 of these keys down to plain "Astra".

The URL path itself embeds a quarter marker ("2026/Q2") that will
presumably roll over every quarter - when these URLs eventually 404,
someone has to visit the listing page in a real browser, copy the new
links, and update `_DOCUMENT_URLS` by hand; there's no way to detect that
automatically short of building the browser-based discovery this module's
docstring says is out of scope."""
