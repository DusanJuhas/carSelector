"""Parser for Peugeot's per-model "Ceník, výbava a technické údaje" price
lists (verified against real PDFs downloaded 2026-09-13 from
peugeot.ecpaper.cz, effective September 2026 - see
scraper/tests/fixtures/peugeot_*.pdf). Covers the current CZ personal-car
lineup with a working price list: 208, 2008, 308 SW, 3008, 408, 5008,
Rifter. Peugeot is a fellow Stellantis brand alongside Opel, and its price
table reads like a simplified version of Opel's own column grid (see
OpelParser's module docstring) - trim/engine/CO2/list price/discount/
promo price, one row per engine - but without Opel's own column-boundary
pitfalls, so this parser is line-sequence based instead of column-position
based (see below for why that's both simpler and more robust here).

Two personal-car nameplates are NOT covered: the plain "308" hatchback's
own "Ceník a tech. data" link on peugeot.cz is dead (404s back to
ecpaper.cz's generic customer/catalogs landing page, verified 2026-09-13
both via `requests` and a real browser) - only "308 SW" (the wagon) has a
working document, so plain "308" is simply omitted, same convention as
CUPRA's own stock-only/not-yet-on-sale omissions (see discovery/cupra.py's
module docstring). Traveller uses a completely different document
structure (a "Ceník Furgon"-style flat list with excl./incl.-VAT price
pairs, closer to Expert/Boxer's own commercial-vehicle documents than to
the personal-car grid every other model here uses) and isn't covered yet.
Expert/Partner/Boxer commercial vehicles are out of scope, same "personal
cars only" convention as every other brand here.

Each row is anchored by its own 16-character alnum product code (e.g.
"1PP2A5HJLKC02PH2" - the same LCDV-style code Opel's own documents use,
unsurprising for a fellow Stellantis brand) on its own physical line
shortly before or after the row's own price line - "before" for most rows
but not all (verified on 3008's own document: a row with no discount/
promo squeezes trim + engine + price onto ONE line and pushes the CO2
figure onto a second line by itself, reversing the usual order). Unlike
Opel, this parser doesn't classify words into columns by x-position at
all - Peugeot's own price line packs the CO2 figure, list price, discount
and promo price tightly together with comparatively narrow, uniform-width
numeric tokens (unlike Opel's wide text tokens like "(81kW/110k)"), but a
wide DISCOUNT value could still in principle bleed across a fixed column
boundary the same way Opel's did. Sidestepping column boundaries (and the
row's own physical line layout) entirely avoids both of those problems:
`_build_variant` finds every "<digits> Kč" run in the row's own combined
text regardless of which line it landed on (the first is always the list
price - discount and promo, when present, are read then discarded, same
convention as every other brand's own promotional column here) and the
"<digits> g" CO2 figure the same way, and builds the engine description
from whatever text is left after removing both - which is how a range
figure like "Dojezd: 362 km" that shares a line with the price ends up
correctly kept as part of the engine text instead of discarded with it.

Trim headings aren't a separate merged cell like Opel's own (see
OpelParser's docstring point 1) - they're printed inline on the very same
line as that trim's first engine row (e.g. "STYLE Turbo 100 MAN6" is ONE
physical line, "STYLE" left of the VÝBAVA/MOTOR column boundary, "Turbo
100 MAN6" right of it), so a trim heading is simply carried forward as
state until the next one is seen - no distance-based assignment needed.

Rifter's own document is the one exception with a real wrinkle: it covers
FOUR sub-tables in one document ("RIFTER", "RIFTER LONG", "RIFTER S
HOMOLOGACÍ N1" and "RIFTER LONG S HOMOLOGACÍ N1", each with its own full
VÝBAVA/MOTOR/... header and row block - verified against a rendered page
image), the same "one document, several sub-tables" shape CUPRA's Leon
"Tribe" special edition uses (see CupraParser's own docstring) rather than
Astra's own separate-HB/ST-documents shape. Each header found on a page
starts its own row-scanning section (up to the next header or the end of
the page); the line immediately before a header, when it's just the
model's own name with an optional suffix, supplies that section's `model`
value (the suffix, if any, appended to the base model name) rather than
being read as a stray trim heading - UNLESS that suffix is an "N1"
homologation one, which is skipped outright: N1 is the EU light-
commercial-vehicle type-approval category (the same tax/registration
classification Combo/Vivaro/Movano's own exclusion above is about, not a
different physical car), so both "S HOMOLOGACÍ N1" sections are out of
scope for the same reason.

Powertrain is classified from the engine column's own text: "Plug-in"
(checked first) is PHEV; "Hybrid" otherwise is Peugeot/Stellantis's own
48V mild-hybrid tech (same tech, same convention as OpelParser's own
"Hybrid" - MHEV, not HEV); "Elektromotor"/"Electric" is EV; everything
else (Turbo/BlueHDi/Diesel petrol and diesel engines) is plain ICE, with
`scripts/import_scraper_data.py`'s own diesel regex needing a new "HDi"
alternative for BlueHDi's own diesel badge (not covered by the existing
TDI/CRDI/CDTI/BMW-suffix patterns).

Like every other brand here except Škoda/VW, the cover page carries no
usable release date in `_pdf_layout.extract_release_date`'s expected
format (the closest text is "Ceny platné na skladové vozy od D. M. RRRR
do D. M. RRRR", a closed campaign window like CUPRA's/Renault's/Opel's
own gap - see their module docstrings), so `release_date` stays None;
VariantRepository falls back to the download date."""
