"""Parser for Dacia's per-model "Ceník" price lists (verified against real
PDFs downloaded 2026-09-07 from dacia.cz's asset CDN, effective 1 July/
1 August 2026 depending on model — see scraper/tests/fixtures/dacia_*.pdf).

Like Kia/Toyota/VW (and unlike Škoda's single combined listing), Dacia
publishes one PDF per model — DaciaDiscoverer resolves six URLs (Spring,
Sandero, Sandero Stepway, Jogger, Duster, Bigster), and DaciaParser reads
each independently, extracting the model name itself from the cover page
(same reason VW/Kia do this: the discoverer's own model key never reaches
the parser, see monitors/source_monitor.py) rather than trusting it. The
cover page's own casing is unreliable enough that a substring match against
the known current lineup (`_KNOWN_MODELS`, longest name first so "Sandero
Stepway" doesn't get read as plain "Sandero") is more robust than parsing a
specific line: Duster's cover repeats the name twice ("DUSTER DUSTER"),
Spring's mixes case within one word ("cENÍK"), and Jogger/Bigster's price-
table headers do too ("MOtOR", "SpláTKa*") — evidently a smallcaps-style
font whose actual glyphs are mixed-case, not a text-transform CSS effect
`extract_text()` would already have normalized away.

Every model's price table is on a single page, one row reading e.g.:

    Essential Eco-G 120 Dacia LPG Kalkulačka 441 900 5 133

trim (only present on a row that starts a new trim group - see below),
engine description (contains its own digits - "120", "140" - so it can't
be told apart from the price by "is a digit" alone), an optional "Dacia
LPG Kalkulačka" annotation (a fixed link label pointing at an LPG cost
calculator - it appears on whichever specific engine row happens to link
to it, not consistently the same one across models, so it's stripped by
exact text match rather than by position), then TWO price-like columns:
the list price (kept as `price`) and a monthly-financing estimate (read
then discarded, same "the columns that don't map to a schema field are
read then skipped" convention as every other brand here).

Rows are split into words by `_pdf_layout.group_into_lines`, then into
column clusters by x-gap (`_cluster_by_gap`): the gap between two words of
the same logical column is always ~2.5-3pt (a price/monthly continuation
number, or "mild"/"hybrid" in "mild hybrid 140"), while every real gap
between columns - trim/engine, engine/annotation, annotation/price, price/
monthly - is at least 24.5pt (verified against real word x0/x1 coordinates
across all six fixtures); `_GAP_THRESHOLD` sits well inside that margin.
This makes a row's own shape self-describing: the LAST cluster is always
the monthly figure (discarded), the one before it the price, and - once
the "Dacia LPG Kalkulačka" cluster (if any) is dropped - whatever's left is
EITHER just the engine text (row continues the current trim) OR trim-then-
engine (two clusters - a new trim group starts). No column x-position needs
to be hardcoded or read off the header for this, unlike BMW/Mercedes-Benz -
a deliberate difference from those, since here the columns' own x0 shifts
by model (Sandero's engine column starts at x0=133.2, Duster/Bigster's at
121.9, Jogger's at 147.4 - all verified), apparently because the price-list
template narrows the trim column to fit each model's own longest trim name.

Jogger is the only model whose one page holds TWO price tables ("VÝBAVA
MOTOR 5 Míst SPLÁTKA" / "... 7 Míst ...", back to back - a 5-seat and a
7-seat price list for the same trim/engine combinations, not two columns of
one table) - `parse` re-reads the "N Míst" marker every time it hits a
header line (same "look for the header on every line, not just once"
principle as SkodaEvParser's two body-style tables) and folds it into
`variant_name` (not `model` - it's a seat-count configuration of the same
Jogger, not a different model), which also keeps
scripts/import_scraper_data.py's powertrain_signature() (dedups by
variant_name with trim stripped out) from collapsing the two tables'
otherwise-identical "Essential Eco-G 120" rows onto each other.

Powertrain is classified from the row's own engine text: "electric" -> EV
(Spring only), "mild hybrid" -> MHEV, plain "hybrid" (no "mild") -> HEV,
everything else (Eco-G/TCe, LPG-capable or not) -> ICE. This is a
simplification verified against Duster's own technical-data page (page
10): the "hybrid 150 4×4"/"hybrid-G 150 4×4" rows are classified there as
"mild hybrid" under "Úroveň elektrifikace", not "full hybrid" like plain
"hybrid 155" - i.e. the technical-data page's own classification doesn't
match the price table's naming for those two rows. Reading the price
table's engine text is still what every other brand's parser here does
(Kia/Toyota's HEV/PHEV, Mazda/BMW's EV/PHEV), and cross-referencing a
different page's table by row position would be far more fragile than the
value it adds for two rows on one model - a known, accepted gap rather
than a silently wrong "fix".

Like Kia/Toyota/Hyundai/Mercedes-Benz/Mazda/BMW, the cover/disclaimer text
reads "platné od D. M. RRRR" (lowercase, no "Platnost") - doesn't match
`_pdf_layout.extract_release_date`'s "Platnost od ..." pattern, so
`release_date` stays None here too; VariantRepository falls back to the
download date."""
