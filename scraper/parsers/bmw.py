"""Parser for BMW's combined "Ceník základních modelů" price list (verified
against the real PDF downloaded 2026-08-29 from bmw.cz, effective from
1 July 2026).

Like Mercedes-Benz, one BMW document covers the entire current lineup - but
unlike Mercedes-Benz's 74-page interactive-brochure export (see
mercedes_benz.py's module docstring) or Mazda's overlapping-text-layer one
(see mazda.py's module docstring), this is a genuinely plain 6-page price
table, closer in spirit to Škoda's single-listing-page simplicity:
`page.extract_words()` needs no de-duplication or font-size filtering here,
just the usual `_pdf_layout.group_into_lines`.

Each model is its own section, headed by a line like "BMW řady 3 Sedan
(G20) / M3 Sedan (G80)" or "BMW X1 (U11)" — `_extract_model` turns that
into a plain name ("3 Series Sedan", "X1") by dropping the "BMW "/"Nový "
marketing prefix, the trailing "(chassis code)", and anything from a "/"
onward (the M-performance chassis annotation - its rows are already part
of the same section, e.g. "M3 Competition M xDrive" is just another row
under "BMW řady 3 Sedan"). "řady N" becomes "N Series". A section that
continues onto a second page repeats its own heading suffixed "-
pokračování" ("continued") - stripped before the same transform, so it
maps back to the same model name rather than starting a new one.

A data row reads e.g.:

    123 xDrive 4 1 998 160/218 134 5,9 890 661 1 077 700

trim designation, cylinder count ("-" for EVs), displacement in cm³ ("-"
for EVs, always a 4-digit number split "N NNN" by the thousands separator
otherwise), power "kW/hp", CO2 g/km, combined consumption (contains a
comma, e.g. "5,9" - never a bare digit token, which is what lets it mark
the boundary between CO2 and the price columns), then TWO prices (ex-VAT,
incl-VAT). `trim` is just the row's own designation and `price` the final
(incl-VAT) column; cylinder count/CO2/consumption aren't part of
`ExtractedVariant`'s schema and are read then discarded, same "the columns
that don't map to a schema field are read then skipped, not stored"
approach as every other parser here - displacement and power ARE kept,
folded into `variant_name` rather than dropped, for a reason that has
nothing to do with display: see `_parse_row`'s comment on
`powertrain_signature`.

The row is anchored on its power column (`\\d+/\\d+`, a shape nothing else
on the line matches) rather than parsed left-to-right, since the trim
designation's own length varies (one word - "M5" - up to four - "M3
Competition M xDrive"): cylinder count and displacement are read backward
from the power column (displacement is always exactly one word if "-",
otherwise exactly two - every real engine here is a 4-digit cm³ figure,
verified across all ~180 rows in the fixture), and the price columns are
read forward. The two prices can't be told apart by counting digit-tokens
alone (a 7-digit price and the 6-digit price before it are BOTH split into
3-digit continuation words with no reliable break, e.g. "656 446 794 300"
for a row where ex-VAT is 656 446 and incl-VAT is 794 300 - every token
after the first is exactly 3 digits) - resolved the same way as Mercedes-
Benz's row-2 price (see that parser's module docstring): consecutive words
belonging to the SAME price sit only ~2-3pt apart, while the real gap
between the ex-VAT and incl-VAT columns is 26pt+ (verified against real
word x0/x1 coordinates) - `_last_price` walks the trailing digit run from
the right and stops at the first gap past `_COLUMN_GAP_THRESHOLD`, keeping
only the rightmost (incl-VAT) group, matching the "price = the VAT-
inclusive consumer list price" convention used for every other brand here.

Powertrain is classified from the MODEL name for electric variants (a
lowercase "i" immediately followed by a digit or "X" - "i3"/"i4"/"i5"/
"i7"/"iX"/"iX1"/"iX2"/"iX3" - each is its own section, entirely separate
from the combustion one it's named after) and per-ROW for plug-in hybrids,
which are mixed into their combustion model's own section rather than
getting one of their own (e.g. "330e" is a row under "BMW řady 3 Sedan",
alongside plain "320i" rows) - BMW's plug-in hybrid trims always end in a
2-3 digit number immediately followed by a lowercase "e" (`_PHEV_RE`),
distinct from the petrol "...i" suffix (e.g. "230i") or the diesel "...d"
suffix (e.g. "320d").

Like Kia/Toyota/Hyundai/Mercedes-Benz/Mazda (and unlike Škoda/VW), the
cover/disclaimer text states a production-month WINDOW ("Od 1. července
2026 pro produkční měsíce červenec 2026 až říjen 2026"), not a single
"Platnost od D. M. RRRR" date - `_pdf_layout.extract_release_date` doesn't
match this format, so `release_date` stays None here too, and
VariantRepository falls back to the download date."""
