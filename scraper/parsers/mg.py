"""Parser for MG's per-model "Ceník" price lists (verified against real
PDFs downloaded 2026-09-13 from mgmotor-czech.cz, effective June-September
2026 depending on model - see scraper/tests/fixtures/mg_*.pdf). Covers
MG3, MGS9 PHEV, MG ZS, MG HS, MG4 EV (Urban), MGS5 EV and MG Cyberster -
MG's entire current CZ lineup as of this verification (unlike most other
brands here, there's no separate commercial-vehicle lineup to exclude -
MG only sells passenger cars in this market).

MG's price table reads like Kia's/Renault's own (a trim heading, then one
row per engine underneath), not a genuine column grid - a line-sequence
reader fits closer than OpelParser's column-position one, but with one
wrinkle neither Kia's nor Renault's own needed: a trim heading covering
more than one engine row is a single cell VERTICALLY MERGED across the
whole group and centered against it (see OpelParser's own docstring point
1 for the same pattern there) - a naive "current trim, carry forward
until the next heading" reader would misplace the last row or two of a
merged group onto the FOLLOWING trim, since the heading's own line can
sit BETWEEN two of the rows it covers, not before all of them (verified
against a rendered page image - MG HS's own document has an entirely
unlabeled first trim group for exactly this reason: its own heading,
"Emotion", is centered against all 4 of its rows and happens to land
between the 2nd and 3rd). `_nearest_trim` - same idea, same name, as
OpelParser's own - assigns each row to whichever trim heading is
vertically closest, correct whether a group has 1 row (heading sits on
that row's own line, distance 0) or several.

Unlike Opel, there's no per-row product code to anchor a row on - MG's
own rows have none - so a line is recognized as a data row simply by
containing a Kč-suffixed price (`_PRICE_RE`, the same regex
PeugeotParser uses). `price` is the FIRST such run on the line (CENA, the
list price) - ZVÝHODNĚNÍ (discount), VÝKUPNÍ BONUS/BONUS PŘI FINANCOVÁNÍ
(a trade-in or financing-only extra discount, on some documents) and
AKČNÍ CENA (the resulting promotional price) are read then discarded the
same as every other brand's own promotional column(s) here - the trailing
column count varies per document (1 to 4 Kč groups) but that never
matters since only the first is read.

Some documents carry a SECOND, promotional-only price table alongside the
regular one: a "skladové vozy" (stock-vehicles-only) one (MG3's own, an
extra discount stacked on the regular one) or a seasonal insert with no
"CENÍK MG <model>" title at all (MG HS's own "SUMMER EDITION" page, a
single row). Both are skipped: a table is only read when the text
immediately above its own header reads "CENÍK MG ..." (in the source PDF
this heading is printed one letter per word - `_looks_like_price_list_title`
strips whitespace before checking) with no "SKLADOV..." word anywhere in
that same text.

`model` is read from the cover page's own "<MODEL> OD <price> Kč" line
(not the giant stylized "CENÍK" heading right above it, which the source
PDF - unlike the model/price line - prints one letter per word), with the
leading "MG" stripped (paralleling Renault's own bare "4"/"5" - `brand`
already supplies "MG" for display) and each remaining word title-cased
except for `_KEEP_UPPERCASE` abbreviations (ZS, HS, EV, PHEV - MG's own
body-style/powertrain suffixes, which would otherwise come out as
"Zs"/"Hs"/"Ev"/"Phev").

Powertrain is classified from the engine text: "PHEV" is printed
literally for MG's plug-in hybrids; "Hybrid+" otherwise is a genuine full
hybrid confirmed via HS's own technical-data page ("BENZÍN, HEV A PHEV")
- HEV, not MHEV; "Synchronní elektromotor" is EV; everything else
(petrol, labelled "Zážehový") is plain ICE. MG doesn't sell diesel in CZ,
so `scripts/import_scraper_data.py`'s diesel regex needed no brand-
specific fix here.

POHON (drivetrain) is printed explicitly per row - "Přední"/"Zadní"/
"4×4" - unlike most other brands here, which don't label it at all (see
`infer_drivetrain`'s own "FWD-default" gap in its docstring). MGS5 EV and
Cyberster both have genuinely rear-wheel-drive trims, so this is kept in
`variant_name`, and `scripts/import_scraper_data.py`'s own
`infer_drivetrain` gained a "zadní" check for it.

Like every other brand here except Škoda/VW, the cover page's own release
date used to fall outside `_pdf_layout.extract_release_date`'s exact
"Platnost od ..." wording ("Platnost ceníku od ...", one extra word) -
that helper's own regex was widened to accept both, so `release_date` is
populated normally here rather than falling back to the download date the
way it does for CUPRA/Renault/Opel/Peugeot."""
