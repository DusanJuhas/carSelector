"""Parser for Ford's per-model "Ceník" price lists (verified against real
PDFs downloaded 2026-09-07 from ford.cz's asset CDN, effective 30 June/
1 July/1 September 2026 depending on model — see scraper/tests/fixtures/
ford_*.pdf). Covers Puma, Kuga, Mustang and Bronco - see module docstring's
"Scope" section below for why the rest of the current CZ lineup isn't
included yet.

Every model's price table is a genuine two-axis matrix - trim (column) by
engine/transmission (row) - unlike every other brand parsed here, which is
effectively a one-column list (a trim heading, then its engine rows). One
cell reads, e.g. (Kuga, page 2):

    Titanium  Top Edition  ST-Line  ST-Line X  Active X  BlueCruise Edition
    649 900   -            699 900  752 900    752 900   -
    725 000   -            775 000  858 000    858 000   -

Each engine row is THREE things stacked vertically in the source (verified
against a rendered page image, not just extracted text - naive text
extraction interleaves them in a confusing order): a "Zvýhodněná cena"
(discounted-with-financing price) row, the engine/transmission description
(Motor/Palivo/Výkon/Převodovka/Pohon - whichever of these columns this
model's header has - wrapping onto 1-2 lines of its own), then a "Základní
cena" (base list price) row - `price` is read from the base row, matching
every other brand's "list price, not a promotional one" convention (Kia's
CENÍKOVÁ CENA, Mazda's CENA, ...). A column with no offering for that row
reads "-" instead of a price; that dash can land on any of the three
lines depending on how many lines the description itself wraps to, so
`parse` doesn't assume a fixed 3-line shape - it tracks "the last two
lines that carried trim-column content (digits or a dash)" as the
discount/base pair for whatever description text accumulated between them
(see `_classify_row_words`/`parse`'s own comments).

Trim columns are read off the header dynamically, not hardcoded - the
header itself needs the same word-clustering technique as Dacia's engine
column (`_HEADER_GAP_THRESHOLD`, ~1.6-1.7pt within one trim's own name,
21.8pt+ between trims, verified against real coordinates) because a
multi-word trim name ("ST-Line X", "BlueCruise Edition") can wrap onto a
line of its own above or below the header's main line. Once a trim's own
left edge is known, `_pdf_layout.column_for_x` (the same helper Škoda's
parser uses) assigns each data word to a column and - critically - keeps a
price split across multiple words by the thousands separator (e.g. "1"
"017" "000") in that SAME column rather than bleeding into the next one.

Everything left of the first trim column (Motor/Palivo/Výkon/Převodovka/
Pohon - which of these a given model's header has varies, see
`_LEFT_LABELS`) is concatenated in reading order into one engine
descriptor string, used both for `variant_name` and for classifying
powertrain via Ford's own "(mHEV)"/"(HEV)"/"(PHEV)" markers on the engine
name (`_classify_powertrain`, same precedence order as Kia's PHEV/MHEV/HEV/
ICE check).

Scope: Ford's CZ lineup has ~10 current models, but only Puma/Kuga/Mustang/
Bronco are covered here - the rest don't fit this parser's column model
and are a known gap for a follow-up, not silently mis-parsed:
- Explorer, Puma Gen-E and Mustang Mach-E (all-electric) add a "Dojezd"
  (range) figure that's either its own per-trim, "/"-separated multi-value
  column (Explorer) sitting BETWEEN the description and the price columns,
  or a single value folded into the description (Mustang Mach-E) - the
  former breaks the "everything left of the first trim column is just
  description text" assumption this parser relies on, and neither
  document's own true trim/price structure has been hand-verified yet the
  way Puma/Kuga/Mustang/Bronco have.
- Tourneo Courier/Connect/Custom use a completely different "AKČNÍ CENÍK"
  layout (a single "bez DPH (s DPH)" price per cell, not a discount/base
  pair) - a different parser's worth of work, not a variant of this one.
- Puma ST and Tourneo Custom MS-RT are single-trim special-edition
  documents whose header replaces "Motor" with "Benzín", which
  `_is_header_line` doesn't recognize (so they're simply skipped, not
  mis-parsed) - low value for the extra special-casing given they're a
  single row each.
- Capri (electric-only) wasn't reachable from this environment to verify
  at all (see `discovery/ford.py`'s module docstring).
`DaciaDiscoverer`-style "only 4 of X models" precedent: matches Kia/Toyota/
Hyundai's "one document format per iteration" rollout, not a permanent
scope decision - see doc/arch/webScraping/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

Like every other brand here, the cover/disclaimer text reads "Všechny ceny
jsou platné od D. M. RRRR" (not "Platnost od ...", `_pdf_layout.
extract_release_date`'s pattern), so `release_date` stays None;
VariantRepository falls back to the download date. The same marker text
(`_END_OF_TABLE_MARKER`) doubles as the "stop reading data rows" signal for
`parse`, since the legal/financing disclaimer paragraph directly below
every price table always opens with it."""
