"""Parser for CUPRA's per-model "Ceník" price lists (verified against real
PDFs downloaded 2026-09-12 from cupraofficial.cz's asset CDN, effective
26 May-17 August 2026 depending on model — see scraper/tests/fixtures/
cupra_*.pdf). Covers Leon, Leon Sportstourer, Formentor, Terramar, Born
and Raval - the full current CZ lineup with a price list at all (Ateca is
sold as stock-only with no price-list PDF of its own, and Tavascan has no
CZ page yet at all - see discovery/cupra.py's module docstring).

Unlike Ford's genuine trim x engine price matrix, CUPRA's price list is a
plain one-column list, much closer to Kia's: a trim heading ("CUPRA", "VZ",
"VZ Extreme", or an "Akční model <name>" special edition), then one row per
engine underneath it, e.g.:

    1.5 TSI 150k 110/150 Manuální 6 st. 5.8 l/100km 132 g/km 809 900 Kč

engine, power ("kW/hp"), transmission, combined consumption, combined CO2,
then the list price ("Cena s DPH") - kept as `price`, matching every other
brand's "list price, not a promotional one" convention. Some rows (Leon
Sportstourer, Terramar) carry a second, discounted "Akční cena s paketem"
price after the first - read then discarded, same convention.

`page.extract_text()` visually scrambles several of these rows (verified
against a rendered page image, not just extracted text, for Terramar):
the consumption figure sits at a slightly different y-offset than the rest
of its own row (apparently vertically centered against a taller row height
than the other columns need), which extract_text()'s own line-breaking
heuristic - tuned tighter than word position alone - splits onto what
looks like its own line. `_pdf_layout.group_into_lines` (tolerance 4pt)
still merges these correctly, because the actual y-gap involved (~3pt) is
well inside that tolerance - same technique Škoda's and Dacia's parsers
use for their own layout quirks, see this module's own verification notes
in scraper/tests/test_cupra_parser.py.

Row shape is otherwise a single regex (`_ROW_RE`), anchored on the
power figure ("110/150") since it's the one token no other field's text
can be mistaken for - everything before it is `engine` (any word count:
"1.5 TSI 150k", "e-HYBRID 204k DSG", "58 kWh", "55,2 kWh 210 k"), and
everything between it and the consumption figure is `transmission`
("Manuální 6 st.", "Aut. DSG7", "Automatická"). A row missing power/
transmission/consumption/CO2 entirely (Born's base 50 kWh trim, in the
source PDF itself, verified against the rendered page) simply doesn't
match `_ROW_RE` and is skipped - a known gap in CUPRA's OWN published
price list, not something to guess a spec for.

Price formatting is inconsistent even across CUPRA's own documents -
Leon/Terramar/Raval space-separate thousands ("1 179 900"), Formentor/Leon
Sportstourer comma-separate them ("1,094,900") - `_parse_price` strips
both, safe since no field here ever needs a fractional-Kč value.

Powertrain is classified from the row's own text: a consumption unit of
"kWh" (vs. "l") -> EV (Born/Raval); "e-HYBRID" in the engine name -> PHEV
(CUPRA's plug-in hybrid); "eTSI" -> MHEV (VW Group's 48V mild-hybrid
petrol engines - same classification Kia/Toyota/Hyundai's parsers already
give their own mild hybrids); everything else -> ICE.

CUPRA's own disclaimer text - "Platnost od D. M. RRRR" or "Platnost od
DD.MM.RRRR" (both forms seen across these six documents) - would actually
satisfy `_pdf_layout.extract_release_date`'s pattern (its `\\s*` between
day/month/year tolerates either spacing), but that text sits on the price-
table page (page 2), not the cover page `extract_release_date` reads
(`pdf.pages[0]` only, hardcoded - CUPRA's own cover is just the model name
over a decorative "Model Configuration" button, see
`_extract_model_name`). So `release_date` stays None here too, for a
different reason than every other brand added so far (a wrong page, not a
wrong date format) - VariantRepository falls back to the download date."""
