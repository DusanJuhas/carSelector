"""Parser for Opel's per-model "Ceníkové a akční ceny" price lists
(verified against real PDFs downloaded 2026-09-12/13 from opel.cz,
effective 7-30 September 2026 - see scraper/tests/fixtures/opel_*.pdf).
Covers the current CZ personal-car lineup with a price list of its own:
Corsa, Astra (hatchback "HB" and "Sports Tourer" wagon, each combining ICE
and Plug-in Hybrid trims in one document), the shared Astra electric
document (covering both body styles), Mokka, Frontera and Grandland
(itself combining ICE and Plug-in Hybrid) - each also with its own
all-electric document. Combo/Vivaro/Movano commercial vehicles are out of
scope, same convention as every other brand here.

Opel's own price table is a genuine grid, but a much simpler one than
Ford's: one column per field (trim/LCDV code/engine/fuel/transmission/list
price/discount/promotional price for combustion & hybrid documents; trim/
LCDV/engine/battery/range/list price/discount/promotional price for the
all-electric ones), one row per engine - closer to Kia's "list" shape than
Ford's matrix, just laid out as real table columns rather than a single
text line per row. This needed a genuine column-position parser rather
than a text-line regex (like Kia's or Renault's), for two reasons
specific to this layout - plus a third that ruled out reusing `_pdf_layout
.column_for_x` (Škoda's own column-position helper) as-is:

1. The trim column is a single cell VERTICALLY MERGED across every engine
   row it covers, vertically centered against that whole group rather
   than repeated per row (verified against a rendered page image - a
   naive `extract_text()` reads a merged trim label as if it were its own
   text line, in reading position order relative to the *nearest* row,
   not the whole group it spans). `_nearest_trim` assigns each row to
   whichever trim heading's own y-position is closest - correct
   regardless of whether a group has 2 rows (heading centered in the gap
   between them) or 3 (heading landing almost exactly on the middle row's
   own baseline) or 1 (the all-electric documents' own simpler layout,
   where the trim is printed inline on the row's own line rather than
   merged - "nearest" is trivially that same row, distance 0).
2. The engine (and, on combustion/hybrid documents, transmission) column
   text wraps onto its own line just above and/or below the row's actual
   data baseline (verified the same way) - e.g. "Hybrid 1.2 TURBO
   (107kW/145k)" above, "Start/Stop eDCT6" below, both belonging to ONE
   row whose LCDV code/prices sit on the baseline between them. Each row
   is anchored by its own LCDV product code (`_LCDV_RE` - a fixed-length,
   fixed-shape token nothing else on the page matches), and every word
   within `_ROW_WINDOW` points of that code's own y-position is pulled
   into the row regardless of which of these 1-3 physical lines it's
   printed on.
3. Column contents aren't reliably left-aligned to their own header, in
   either direction - a wide MOTOR value like "(81kW/110k)" can start
   past the midpoint toward PALIVO's own anchor (there's no shortage of
   horizontal room in this column, so its wrapped sub-lines don't hug the
   left edge the way a narrower field would), while a wide SLEVA value
   like "100.000" starts further left than a narrower one in the same
   column (numbers right-align within their own cell). `column_for_x`'s
   own left-edge-plus-small-tolerance scheme assumes neither happens;
   `_column_for_x` here uses MIDPOINT boundaries between adjacent header
   anchors instead (immune to the second case), and PALIVO/PŘEVODOVKA are
   dropped from the boundary set entirely rather than tuned around (immune
   to the first) - see that function's and the boundary-building code's
   own comments for both.

Column positions themselves aren't hardcoded (verified they shift by
~50pt between Corsa's and Grandland's own documents) - `_column_anchors`
reads them straight off each page's own header row every time, the same
principle as every position-based parser here. One document (Mokka
Electric) mislabels its LCDV-code column header as "MOTOR" too instead of
"LCDV KÓD" - `_column_anchors` special-cases a repeated "MOTOR" label,
see its own comment.

Prices use "." as the thousands separator ("459.990", or "1.049.990" for
a 7-digit one) - `_parse_price` just strips every "." (no field here ever
needs a fractional-Kč value, so this is unambiguous). `price` is read from
"CENÍKOVÁ CENA" (the list price), filtered through `_PRICE_TOKEN_RE` to
drop any non-numeric word that ends up in that bucket (harmless spillover
from the boundary approach above, e.g. the all-electric documents' own
"DOJEZD" unit "km") - "SLEVA" (discount) and "AKČNÍ CENA" (the resulting
promotional price) are read then discarded, same convention as every
other brand's own promotional column here.

Powertrain is classified from the engine column's own text: "PHEV" is
printed literally for Opel's plug-in hybrids (e.g. "1.6 TURBO (143 kW/
195k) PHEV"); "Elektromotor" for the all-electric documents; "Hybrid"
otherwise is Opel/Stellantis's own 48V mild-hybrid tech (confirmed against
Corsa's technical-data page, which lists "Trakce: mild-hybrid" for the row
whose price-table engine text just says "Hybrid") - matches MHEV, not
HEV; everything else is plain ICE.

Like most other brands here, the cover page carries no usable date - the
real "Ceník platí od D. M. do D. M. RRRR" validity line is a closed
campaign window on the price-table page itself (not the single, open-
ended "Platnost od" date `_pdf_layout.extract_release_date` looks for, on
top of being on the wrong page anyway - see CUPRA's and Renault's own
module docstrings for that half of the same gap), so `release_date` stays
None; VariantRepository falls back to the download date."""
