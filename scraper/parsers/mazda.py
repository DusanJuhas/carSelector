"""Parser for Mazda price lists (CX-5, 3, CX-30 — verified against real PDF
price lists downloaded 2026-08-29 from media-assets.mazda.eu, effective
2026-07/2026-08).

Mazda's price-list PDFs are a fundamentally different animal from every
other brand here: not a plain print-style price list, but a 25-38 page
"digital brochure" (clearly exported from an interactive web page - model
overview, trim walkthrough, colors, accessories, equipment matrix, THEN a
couple of pages of price tables) with a page size roughly double a normal
page's width. Two artifacts of that export process make naive
`page.extract_text()`/`page.extract_words()` unusable for the price pages:

1. **Off-page duplicate content.** Words extend from roughly -815pt to
   +815pt, while the visible page is only 0-842pt wide (`page.width`) -
   half the page's own words sit entirely outside the visible area,
   apparently a mirrored/duplicate copy of the whole layout. Excluded by
   only keeping chars with `0 <= x0` and `x1 <= page.width`.
2. **Overlapping same-position text runs, even within the visible half.**
   A large (16pt) section-anchor word (e.g. "CENÍK") and the small (6-8pt)
   real price-table text both start at nearly the same (top, x0) - close
   enough that `page.extract_words()`'s own word-boundary heuristic
   splices their characters together into one garbled token (verified via
   `page.chars`: two runs at the same top with overlapping x-ranges but
   different `size`). Filtering out characters with `size > 9` removes the
   anchor text (nothing in the actual price rows is that large) without
   needing to know what any specific anchor word says.

Even after both filters, a handful of REAL price rows come out doubled or
merged too - not because of the two problems above, but because Mazda
duplicates each row a second time nearby as a short "<trim> <list price>"
echo (no other columns), on a `top` typically 1-7pt below the real row's
own `top`. Unlike (1)/(2), this can't be filtered away by position or
font size alone - `_clean_lines` instead groups words by EXACT `top`
(rounded to 1 decimal - real distinct rows differ by >1pt, verified
against every row in the three fixtures) rather than the tolerance-based
`_pdf_layout.group_into_lines` every other parser uses (that tolerance is
exactly what would smear a real row and its echo together here). Each
resulting line is then validated by column count (see `_ROW_COLUMNS`
below) - matches keeps a fixed catalog price is the leftmost data column,
matching the "Cena" (list price incl. VAT) header - so the echo lines
(1 column) and any rare cross-row collision (verified: the fixtures have
a couple of pages where two rows land on the exact same rounded top,
producing more or fewer than `_ROW_COLUMNS` columns) both fail validation
and are silently dropped rather than risk extracting a wrong number -
same "skip rather than guess" precedent as every other parser here.

A real row (once cleanly isolated) reads e.g.:

    Prime-Line 875 900 Kč 51 000 Kč 824 900 Kč 824 900 Kč 4 999 Kč 5 161 Kč 12 343 Kč

i.e. trim name, then CENA (list price, incl. VAT per the page's own "Ceny
jsou uvedeny včetně DPH" footnote) / MODELOVÝ BONUS / AKČNÍ CENA / NEJNIŽŠÍ
CENA ZA POSLEDNÍCH 30 DNÍ / three monthly-payment columns. Only CENA (the
first column) is kept as `price` - the rest are a time-limited monthly
promotion, same "only the list price, not the promotional columns"
precedent as Kia (see kia.py's module docstring).

Trim levels vary by model (Prime-Line/Centre-Line/Exclusive-Line/Homura
for CX-5; those plus Takumi/Nagisa/Homura Plus for 3 and CX-30) and aren't
hardcoded - the trim name is just whatever text precedes the first price
column on a valid row. The preceding non-price line mentioning "SKYACTIV"
(e.g. "2.5L e-SKYACTIV G 2WD", "e-SKYACTIV G 140 K Manuální převodovka
6MT") is tracked as the engine/drivetrain context and folded into
`variant_name` (same "running section header" convention as Hyundai's
`trim`/Škoda's trim-level tracking) - AWD variants say so directly in that
text ("...G AWD"), which is enough for the shared `infer_drivetrain` regex
in `scripts/import_scraper_data.py` to classify them correctly without
this parser needing its own drivetrain field.

Model 3 (hatchback vs sedan) is the only one of the three with two body
styles - `_BODY_STYLE_MARKERS` reads the "CENY HATCHBACK"/"CENY SEDAN"
header repeated on every page of each section and comes out as "3" vs
"3 Sedan" respectively, same principle as Mercedes-Benz's sedan/estate
split (see mercedes_benz.py's module docstring) - CX-5 and CX-30 are
single-body-style and always keep the bare model name.

None of the three fixtures' price pages state "mild hybrid"/"MHEV" (unlike
Mercedes/Hyundai) even though Mazda's own marketing elsewhere calls this
generation's engines "M Hybrid" 48V-assisted - since that phrase isn't in
the price-table text itself, `powertrain` stays the neutral "ICE" default
here rather than inferring it from outside knowledge.

Like Kia/Toyota/Hyundai/Mercedes-Benz (and unlike Škoda/VW), the cover
page states a promotional order/delivery WINDOW ("Platí pro vozy objednané
od 1.7. a dodané do 30.9.2026"), not a single "Platnost od D. M. RRRR"
date - `_pdf_layout.extract_release_date` doesn't match this format, so
`release_date` stays None here too, and VariantRepository falls back to
the download date."""
