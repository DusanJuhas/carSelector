"""Parser for Renault's per-model "Ceník" price lists (verified against
real PDFs downloaded 2026-09-12 from Renault Group's asset CDN, effective
1 August-10 September 2026 depending on model — see scraper/tests/fixtures/
renault_*.pdf). Covers the full current CZ personal-car lineup with a
price list of its own: Clio, Captur, Symbioz, Arkana, Austral, Espace,
Rafale, Twingo, Renault 4, Renault 5, Megane and Scenic (the last five are
"e-tech elektrický" - electric-only - documents; Kangoo/Trafic/Master are
commercial vehicles, out of scope for a personal car selector).

Renault shares its parent Renault Group's own CDN with Dacia
(`cdn.group.renault.com/ren/...` vs. Dacia's `.../dac/...`), but the price-
list PDF template itself is different - closer to Kia's shape (a trim
heading, then one row per engine underneath) than Dacia's. A row reads,
e.g.:

    TCe 115 434 000 399 000 4 050

engine, then TWO OR THREE trailing numeric columns depending on the
model/document - always "ceníková cena" (the list price, kept as `price`,
matching every other brand's convention) first, then 0-1 promotional/
bonus-adjusted prices, then a monthly financing instalment last - all read
then discarded except the first. Twingo's own price list omits the
promotional column entirely (engine, price, instalment - just two trailing
numbers); every other document here has three. Rather than assume a fixed
column count, `_parse_row` counts how many ALL-DIGIT clusters trail the
line and takes the first (leftmost) one as `price`, whatever that count
turns out to be - see that function's own docstring.

Column detection reuses the same word-gap clustering Dacia's and Ford's
parsers use (`_cluster_by_gap`): the gap between two words of the same
logical column (a thousands-separator continuation like "434"/"000", or
adjoining words within the engine text like "full"/"hybrid"/"E-Tech"/"160")
is consistently ~1.7-1.8pt, while the real gap between the engine text and
the first price column is 150pt+ (verified against real word coordinates
across all twelve fixtures) - `_GAP_THRESHOLD` sits well inside that
margin, so an engine description ending in its own digit (e.g. "TCe 115",
"full hybrid E-Tech 160") is never mistaken for the start of the price
columns: the digit stays clustered with its own non-digit neighbours,
and a cluster with even one non-digit word in it never counts as a price
column.

Trim headings ("EVOLUTION", "TECHNO", "ESPRIT ALPINE", ...) are printed in
consistent ALL CAPS in most of these documents, but the electric Renault
5's PDF renders them in a smallcaps-style font with genuinely mixed-case
glyphs ("teCHno", "RolanD-GaRRoS" - same underlying quirk as Dacia's own
smallcaps font, see dacia.py's module docstring) - `.title()` normalizes
both to the same "Techno"/"Roland-Garros" spelling `parse` uses everywhere
else, and is a no-op for the already-correct documents.

Powertrain is classified from the row's own engine text - Renault's own
"Úroveň elektrifikace" (electrification level) terminology, verified
against Rafale's technical-data page: "mild hybrid" -> MHEV, "full hybrid"
-> HEV, "hyper hybrid" -> PHEV (Rafale's own plug-in variant, confirmed by
its spec page listing a 22 kWh traction battery and 105 km electric-only
range under that exact name, vs. "full hybrid"'s 2 kWh/0 km) - except for
the five documents that are themselves entirely electric (Twingo/4/5/
Megane/Scenic's own "e-tech elektrický" price lists), which don't repeat
an electric marker on every row the way Cupra's kWh/100km consumption
figure does - `_ELECTRIC_MODELS` classifies every row in those five as EV
directly from the model, not the row text.

Like most other brands here, the cover page carries no usable release
date (just the model name over a version subtitle) - the real "Platnost
ceníku od D. M. RRRR" disclaimer is on the price-table page instead, same
gap as CUPRA's own (see cupra.py's module docstring) - so `release_date`
stays None; VariantRepository falls back to the download date."""
