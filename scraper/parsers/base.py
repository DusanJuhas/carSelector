"""Common interface for all per-OEM price list/equipment parsers.

Every brand has its own PDF layout, so instead of one universal parser
there's a single `BaseParser` and per-OEM implementations. If a brand has
structurally different lineups (e.g. Škoda: combustion models vs. EVs
have a completely different table), they get their own parser
(skoda_ice.py, skoda_ev.py) instead of branching inside one — see
doc/arch/webScraping/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

A new brand/lineup = a new file in this directory + registration in
config/sources.yaml (parser_key), nothing else needs to change.
