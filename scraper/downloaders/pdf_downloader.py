# A bare `requests` GET (no headers at all) gets a 403 from an Akamai WAF
# in front of Opel's own CDN specifically (verified 2026-09-12) - every
# other brand's CDN accepts a bare request fine, so this was never needed
# before. A realistic full browser fingerprint clears it; a partial one
# (tested individually: User-Agent alone, +Accept, +Accept-Language,
# +Referer, +Sec-Fetch-* alone, +sec-ch-ua* alone) does not - Akamai's
# check appears to score how many "this looks like a real browser
# navigation" signals are present together, not any single header, so a
# comprehensive set is the robust choice here rather than a minimal one
# that might stop clearing it if that scoring shifts slightly. No
# `Referer` needed - `Sec-Fetch-Site: none` (what a real browser sends for
# a direct, un-referred navigation) is enough, which also keeps this
# usable for any brand's URL without knowing which page "referred" it.
# Confirmed harmless for every other already-working brand's own CDN
# (Dacia/Ford/CUPRA all still 200 with this applied).
