"""Downloads the current Opel CZ personal-car price lists into
scraper/tests/fixtures/, for use as parser test fixtures (see
scraper/parsers/opel.py once it exists).

Needed as a manual, one-off step because opel.cz sits behind an Akamai WAF
that blocks automated downloads at the TLS/network-fingerprint level, not
just on missing headers - verified 2026-09-12: Windows' own curl.exe
(which uses the Schannel TLS stack) gets a 403 even with a complete,
realistic browser header set, while Python's `requests` (a different TLS
stack) gets a 200 with the exact same headers and URL. Run this with the
same Python environment the rest of the project uses (the repo-root venv -
`requests` is already a dependency there, see requirements.txt) - a
pip-less `curl`/PowerShell `Invoke-WebRequest`-based version would hit the
same Schannel block this script exists to route around.

The scraper's own normal downloader (scraper/downloaders/pdf_downloader.py)
uses this exact same header set for exactly this reason - once
`scraper/monitors/discovery/opel.py` can find these URLs on its own
(currently blocked the same way the HTML listing page is - a full browser
engine, not just headers, would be needed there), the regular
`python -m scraper.main` pipeline downloads them itself and this script
stops being needed. Until then, this is the manual substitute for
discovery: the target URLs are hardcoded below rather than found on the
listing page.
