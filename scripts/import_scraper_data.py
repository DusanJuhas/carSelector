"""Imports scraper's parsed price-list data (storage/scraper.db) into the
backend's normalized catalog (storage/drivewise.db, or wherever
DATABASE_URL points).

scraper/ and backend/ deliberately use two different schemas (document-
centric vs. normalized catalog) with no live pipeline between them - see
storage/README.md and the drivewise-data-model skill. This script is that
missing one-way import step. It's a standalone script, not part of either
service's request path - run it manually after a scrape:

    python scripts/import_scraper_data.py [--dry-run]

Safe to re-run: brands/models/trims/powertrains/configurations are looked
up by natural key before creating, and prices only get a new row when the
price actually changed (closing the previous one) - matching the
append-only design in app/models/price.py.

Equipment/options: scraper's equipment_assignment now carries a
surcharge_amount for the one format that has one so far (Škoda's
"Samostatné prvky výbavy" page, see parsers/skoda_equipment.py) - those
rows import as option_items/option_availability (category=equipment).
Rows this still can't import, without fabricating data:
- OPTIONAL rows with no surcharge_amount (no price to satisfy drivewise's
  'optional' CHECK constraint) - counted in equipment_skipped.
- PACKAGE rows - drivewise's AvailabilityStatus has no equivalent state
  yet (standard/optional/unavailable only) - counted in equipment_skipped.
scraper's STANDARD/NOT_AVAILABLE map onto drivewise's standard/unavailable
directly (no surcharge needed for either).

What it still deliberately does NOT import (documented gaps, not silently
dropped):
- model.category (body type), model_year, colors, and most of
  powertrains' spec columns (transmission, displacement_cc, consumption,
  co2, ...): none of these are structured fields in scraper's schema, only
  free text in variant_name/raw_text. Left null, same "not derivable from
  the source" stance already documented for the hand-seeded fixtures.
- fuel_type/drivetrain ARE inferred from variant_name text (see
  infer_fuel_type/infer_drivetrain below) since drivewise requires them
  (NOT NULL) - this is a heuristic, not a parse of a structured field, and
  can be wrong on unusual naming. power_kw is opportunistically extracted
  the same way, staying None where no reliable "NNN kW" substring exists
  (e.g. Toyota's price lists only state hp, not kW).

Note: `powertrains.manufacturer_code` is repurposed here to hold a
fingerprint of this script's own dedup key (see signature_fingerprint),
not a real manufacturer order code - only rows created by this script use
it that way.

Code style: the free functions below (slugify, infer_fuel_type, ...) are
small, stateless, single-purpose helpers with no shared state - per
drivewise-architecture's Code style section, they stay plain functions.
`ScraperDataImporter` is the opposite case (a run's per-brand/model/trim/
powertrain/configuration/source-document caches genuinely are shared,
mutated state across every get_or_create_* call for that run) - a class,
with the caches as instance attributes instead of a dict threaded through
every function call.
