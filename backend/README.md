# DriveWise AI – backend

FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL (target) / SQLite (current default, see Database below). See
`doc/prompt/CLAUDE.md` for repo-wide conventions and `doc/api-contract.md` for the endpoint/schema
contract (source of truth for request/response shapes — keep it in sync with `app/schemas` when
either changes).

## Layout

```
app/
  db/        engine/session, declarative Base
  models/    SQLAlchemy models (the catalog: brands/models/trims/powertrains/configurations/...)
  schemas/   Pydantic request/response shapes, matching doc/api-contract.md
  services/  business logic - catalog queries, the deterministic recommendation engine,
             conversation orchestration
  ai/        the only place Claude API calls are allowed to happen (CLAUDE.md convention)
  api/       FastAPI routers
  ui/        the chat UI (NiceGUI, mounted onto this same app - see the UI section below)
  main.py    app instance, router wiring, error-shape exception handler, UI mounting
```

## Setup

Python dependencies are consolidated in one `requirements.txt`/`requirements-dev.txt` pair at the
**repo root** (shared with `scraper/` — see there for why), so the venv lives at the repo root too,
not here:

```bash
cd ..                          # repo root, if you're in backend/
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate         # Windows; `source .venv/bin/activate` elsewhere
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # requirements.txt + pytest/httpx for running tests
cd backend
```

Commands below (`uvicorn`, `alembic`, `pytest`) still need to run with `backend/` as the working
directory (that's where `app/`, `alembic.ini`, etc. live) — only dependency installation moved.

`DATABASE_URL` defaults to a SQLite file at `storage/drivewise.db` (repo root, see
`storage/README.md`) — no database server to install, see Database below. To use PostgreSQL
instead, set `DATABASE_URL` (or create a `.env` file):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://drivewise:drivewise@localhost:5432/drivewise
```

The AI layer supports two providers, chosen via `AI_PROVIDER` (default `anthropic`) - both are
called through the same `app/ai/llm.py` interface (`LlmClient.complete()`), so nothing outside
`app/ai/client.py` needs to know which one is active:

```
AI_PROVIDER=anthropic          # or "groq" - default is anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5   # optional, this is the default

# only needed if AI_PROVIDER=groq
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b   # optional, this is the default
```

Groq (https://console.groq.com) has a free, no-credit-card developer tier - useful for dev/testing
without spending Anthropic credits, at the cost of a different (generally less instruction-precise)
model family; see the verification note below, which applies per-provider, not just to Claude.

Instead of putting a key in `.env`, an **admin** can enter it in the running app: the header's "AI
klíč" button (shown to admins only, see Login below) opens a dialog whose value is kept in process
memory only (never written to disk) and overrides the environment's key. It has to be re-entered
after every restart, and it is process-wide (every visitor's AI calls use it) - which is why it is
admin-only.

There is no default for either provider's API key — `app/ai/client.py` raises loudly if the
*selected* provider's key is missing, rather than running the AI layer silently disabled. The
conversation flow degrades to a graceful "AI not configured" message without it (see the UI section
below - `ai_not_configured` is still the underlying error code, only now surfaced by the UI
directly rather than as an HTTP 503); the catalog data (brands/models/vehicles) don't need it at
all, regardless of provider.

The UI additionally uses:

```
NICEGUI_STORAGE_SECRET=...   # optional locally - see app/core/config.py; set a real value before
                              # any shared/public deployment
```

### Login (email code) and admins

Anyone can use the catalog, chat and wizard without an account. Logging in is by **email only, no
password**: enter an address, receive a 6-digit code, type it in (`app/services/auth.py`,
`app/ui/components/login_dialog.py`). Any address can create a regular account this way - the first
successful login creates it. **Admin rights** (the `/admin` console, the "AI klíč" button) are never
self-service: an address becomes admin only by being listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS` (applied at its next
login, grant-only - removing an address from the list does not demote anyone) or by having
`users.is_admin` set in the database.

```
ADMIN_EMAILS=you@example.cz,colleague@example.cz   # comma-separated; empty = nobody is admin
EMAIL_BACKEND=smtp            # "console" (the default) sends NOTHING - see below
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.cz
SMTP_SECURITY=starttls        # or "ssl" (implicit TLS) / "none" (unencrypted, trusted local relay only)
SMTP_PORT=587                 # optional: defaults to 587 / 465 / 25 for starttls / ssl / none
SMTP_USER=...                 # usually the full address
SMTP_PASSWORD=...             # an app password where the provider requires one
SMTP_FROM=no-reply@example.cz # defaults to SMTP_USER; many providers only accept their own address
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Rovis          # display name in the inbox

# Optional tuning - defaults shown
AUTH_SECRET=...               # keys the hash codes are stored under; defaults to NICEGUI_STORAGE_SECRET
LOGIN_CODE_TTL_MINUTES=10
LOGIN_CODE_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5     # wrong guesses before a code is burned
LOGIN_CODE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_EMAIL_HOUR=5
LOGIN_CODE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_IP_HOUR=20
AUTH_SESSION_DAYS=30
```

`backend/.env.example` is a ready-to-copy template with these and the provider presets below.

**Sending real email.** Out of the box `EMAIL_BACKEND=console`: the login dialog works, but the code is
only *printed in the server log* and no email is sent (the dialog says so). To send real mail, use any
SMTP account:

1. Put `EMAIL_BACKEND=smtp` and the `SMTP_*` settings in `backend/.env` (or the environment).
2. Check them without going through the login flow:
   `python scripts/send_test_email.py you@example.cz` - prints what it is using, whether the server
   accepted the message, and a hint for the common failures (wrong password, wrong TLS mode/port,
   sender refused, unreachable server).
3. Restart the app. At startup it logs how codes will be delivered (a loud warning for `console`, an
   error naming the problem for an incomplete `smtp` config).

| Provider | `SMTP_HOST` | `SMTP_SECURITY` (port) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resend | `smtp.resend.com` | `starttls` (587) | `SMTP_USER=resend`; password is an API key; sandbox sender `onboarding@resend.dev` only reaches your own account email until you verify a domain |
| Seznam.cz | `smtp.seznam.cz` | `ssl` (465) or `starttls` (587) | user = full address; sender must be that address |
| Gmail | `smtp.gmail.com` | `starttls` (587) | needs 2-step verification + an *app password* |
| Brevo / Mailgun / SendGrid | from the provider's SMTP page | usually `starttls` (587) | verify the sender address/domain there |

Switching providers only ever means changing these `SMTP_*` values - `app/services/mailer.py` talks
plain SMTP and doesn't know which provider it's pointed at.

Connections are always TLS-verified (system trust store, hostname checked) - a server whose
certificate doesn't verify is refused rather than trusted, and the password is never sent before the
connection is encrypted. "The server accepted the message" is not "it reached the inbox": mail from
your own domain also needs SPF and DKIM DNS records (your provider lists them), otherwise the codes
land in spam. A mailbox provider such as Seznam or Gmail needs none of that but only lets you send
from that mailbox's own address.

Codes are stored only as a keyed hash, are single-use, and requesting a new one invalidates the
old. Set a real `NICEGUI_STORAGE_SECRET` (it signs the session cookie) before any shared
deployment. The per-IP limit uses the connection's address; behind a reverse proxy, make uvicorn
trust its forwarded headers (`--forwarded-allow-ips`), otherwise every visitor shares the proxy's
address and its limit. A session is checked against the database on every page load, so
deactivating an account (`users.is_active = false`) or removing `is_admin` takes effect on the
user's next page load.

The `users` / `login_codes` tables come from an Alembic migration - run `alembic upgrade head` after
pulling (`scripts/run.bat` does it for you). The REST API (`/api/*`) is unchanged and still
unauthenticated; login only gates the UI.

**Saved requirements.** For a logged-in user, the "Technické požadavky" drawer survives a page
reload or a new login session: `app/services/saved_requirements.py` keeps one JSON snapshot of
`StructuredRequirements` per user (`saved_requirements` table), restored on `ConversationState.
begin()` and overwritten after every chat/wizard turn. Logged-out browsing is unaffected - nothing
is saved, and `ConversationState.restart()` (the header's "Restartovat") also deletes the saved
snapshot server-side rather than leaving a reload silently bring it back.

**The AI layer (`app/ai/requirement_interpreter.py`, `app/ai/explanation_generator.py`) was
written without access to a live API key and has not been exercised against either real provider.**
Verify prompt behavior before relying on it: does it reliably return JSON-only, is the
follow-up-question quality reasonable, and — both system prompts explicitly instruct this, but
it's an instruction, not a guarantee — does the model's free-text output (`follow_up_question`,
the per-vehicle explanation) actually come back in Czech, matching the rest of the UI (see
`doc/prompt/CLAUDE.md`'s language convention). Every *hardcoded* string in `app/services/
conversation.py` and the two AI modules already is Czech — that part went unverified for a while
since nothing rendered it live until a real UI was wired to this logic, not a scripted mock with
its own separately-authored Czech copy.

### Shared links

"Sdílet" (results header, vehicle detail) stores a frozen, read-only copy of the result and gives a
link `/s/<token>` that works without an account (`app/services/sharing.py`,
`app/ui/shared_page.py`). The link carries no author identity; the page is `noindex`.

```
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://rovis.example.cz   # origin for links/QR codes; unset = the request's own origin
SHARE_TTL_DAYS=30                          # how long a link stays valid
```

Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` wherever the app runs behind a proxy, or the links may point at an internal
address.

## Database

SQLite (a local file, `storage/drivewise.db`, gitignored) is the default for now, so the app runs
without installing anything database-related. The schema (`app/models/`, the Alembic migration) is
written to stay dual-dialect rather than SQLite-only — see `app/db/base.py`'s `BigIntPK` (SQLite
only auto-increments a PK when the column is literally `INTEGER`, unlike Postgres's `BIGSERIAL`)
and the `prices` table's partial unique index (`postgresql_where`/`sqlite_where` pair) — so
switching `DATABASE_URL` to Postgres later needs no model/migration changes.

```bash
alembic upgrade head      # creates storage/drivewise.db and the schema in it
python -m app.db.seed     # seeds two real, hand-verified vehicles (Mazda CX-5, VW Tiguan) - safe to
                           # re-run, skips if the DB already has data
```

`python -m app.db.seed` also calls `Base.metadata.create_all()` first, so on a totally fresh
checkout you can skip straight to it without running `alembic upgrade head` separately — Alembic
remains the source of truth for schema history either way (`alembic_version` gets stamped once you
do run it).

For real (not hand-seeded) catalog data, `python scripts/import_scraper_data.py` (repo root) loads
whatever `scraper/` has found in `storage/scraper.db` — see that script's docstring and
`storage/README.md` for what it does and doesn't carry over. Both can populate the same DB; run
either or both.

## Run (API + UI)

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

One process, one command: `http://localhost:8000/` serves the UI, interactive API docs are at
`http://localhost:8000/docs`, and `GET /api/brands` / `GET /api/vehicles` serve the REST API
directly (for any client other than the bundled UI). Try the API routes after seeding to see real
data.

## UI

The chat UI lives in `app/ui/` — [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io) (Python), mounted directly onto this
same FastAPI app via `ui.run_with` (see the bottom of `app/main.py`). No Node.js/npm/separate
frontend process anywhere; the UI calls the service layer (`app/services/`) in-process instead of
over HTTP, using the same Pydantic response models the REST API returns (no separate wire-format
types to keep in sync, unlike a browser-based client would need).

```
app/ui/
  pages.py                  the whole app - one @ui.page("/"), wires everything together
  state.py                  per-connection state (ConversationState/CatalogState dataclasses) -
                             NiceGUI gives each browser connection its own call of pages.index(),
                             so plain local variables/closures are already private per connection;
                             no global store needed
  db.py                     per-action database sessions (see its docstring for why - `Depends`
                             only resolves once, at the initial page load, not on every later
                             click/message send)
  i18n.py                   Czech UI copy (the only language this app ships - see its docstring)
  money.py, sort.py         format_money() / sort_cars(), small pure helpers
  styles.py                 the design tokens (see doc/design-tokens.md), injected once via
                             ui.add_css - NiceGUI ships Tailwind support built in, so the same
                             utility classes work directly
  components/                one file per screen section (header, chat column, results grid,
                             requirements drawer, vehicle detail modal)
```

**Language:** Czech only, same as every other user-facing string in this codebase (see
`doc/prompt/CLAUDE.md`'s language convention) — all UI copy goes through `app/ui/i18n.py`'s `t()`/
`t_count()` against its `STRINGS` dict, not hardcoded strings in `components/`. Prices are always a
`Money` (`{amount, currency}`), formatted via `app/ui/money.py`'s `format_money()`.

**Browsing mode vs. narrowed mode:** the results area shows one of two things, decided by
`ConversationState.has_narrowed`:
- **Browsing** (default, and whenever the AI hasn't actually searched yet): the full catalog,
  loaded page by page via `CatalogState`/`app.services.catalog.list_vehicles` ("Načíst další" to
  fetch another page). Needs no conversation and no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - it's what you see before
  typing anything, and what you're left with if the AI layer isn't configured.
- **Narrowed**: once a chat turn's response has `searched=True` (the recommendation engine actually
  ran), the AI-ranked/filtered shortlist from that turn. `has_narrowed` stays `True` through later
  follow-up-only turns (a real zero-match search must show "0 matches", not silently fall back to
  the catalog) - only restarting clears it.

**Sorting:** the dropdown offers recommended/price-ascending/price-descending/alphabetical/a
user-dragged "Moje pořadí" order. Price/alphabetical in browsing mode go to the backend and reset
to page 1 (sorting only the page(s) already loaded would be wrong); every option in narrowed mode,
and the custom order in either mode, sorts client-side via `app/ui/sort.py`'s `sort_cars()` against
whatever's already loaded. Drag-reordering uses NiceGUI's `make_sortable()` and persists across
reloads via `app.storage.user` (server-side, keyed by the browser's session cookie - the practical
equivalent of `localStorage` for a Python-only UI, see `state.py`/`pages.py`).

**Vehicle detail:** clicking a card (browsing or narrowed) opens a dialog with the full detail
(powertrain, colors, standard/optional equipment, price history) for that configuration, fetched on
open via `app/ui/state.py`'s `fetch_vehicle_detail`. Closes on backdrop click, Escape, or its close
button - all for free from NiceGUI's `ui.dialog` default (non-`persistent`) behavior.

**Admin console (`/admin`, `app/ui/admin.py`):** lets you trigger the scraper and the scraper →
catalog import from the browser - a "Spustit" (run) button per job, with the subprocess's live
output streamed into a scrollable log and a "Hotovo"/"Chyba" (done/error) status once it exits.
Also lists every configured OEM source (`config/sources.yaml`) with its active/inactive status.
Both jobs run as real subprocesses (`sys.executable -m scraper.main` /
`sys.executable scripts/import_scraper_data.py`), not in-process imports of `scraper`/`scripts`
code - keeps that boundary a real process boundary, so a scraper crash can't take the app down.
Running the scraper alone does **not** update the catalog the chat UI shows - run the import step
afterward for that (see the on-page description of each). **Admin-only**: anonymous visitors get a
login prompt and regular accounts a "no admin rights" note instead of the console - see Login above.
The header's "Admin" link is only shown to admins, but the real check is on the page itself (an
unprivileged browser never receives the job buttons at all).

## Tests

```bash
pytest                    # everything: REST API tests + UI tests
pytest tests/ui           # just the UI layer
```

`tests/conftest.py` spins up a throwaway in-memory SQLite DB per test (via `Base.metadata.create_all`,
not Alembic), seeds it via `app.db.seed.seed_demo_data()` — the same real sample data drawn from
the Mazda CX-5 and VW Tiguan price lists in `storage/cars/` that `python -m app.db.seed` writes to
the persistent dev DB, one source of truth for both — and drives the FastAPI app through `TestClient` - so the
catalog endpoints (brands/models/vehicles/compare) are exercised end to end, not just imported. The
conversation endpoints are tested only up to the point that requires a live Claude API call (they
correctly degrade without a key); the AI layer itself isn't covered by this suite.

`seed_demo_data()` assigns every id explicitly rather than relying on autoincrement - not required
for correctness (see `BigIntPK` below, which makes autoincrement work on SQLite too), but it keeps
the seed deterministic and makes cross-referencing ids (e.g. `config_prime_2wd_id`) trivial in
tests.

`tests/ui/` covers the UI layer against that same seeded database (`tests/ui/conftest.py` patches
`app.ui.db.get_session` to yield it) - `test_state.py` exercises `ConversationState`/`CatalogState`
directly against real service calls (browsing-mode load, the `ai_not_configured` path, restart),
and `test_sort.py`/`test_money.py`/`test_i18n.py` cover the pure-function helpers. These are plain
async pytest tests, not NiceGUI's `User`-fixture DOM simulation: that fixture's current (NiceGUI
3.x) setup expects a `main_file` containing a literal `ui.run()` call, which doesn't fit this app's
`ui.run_with(app, ...)`-mounted-onto-an-existing-FastAPI-app structure - testing the state layer
directly covers the actual risk (real DB/orchestrator calls) independent of that mismatch. The
`nicegui.testing.user_plugin` pytest plugin is still registered (`pyproject.toml`) for whenever
that's worth revisiting.

## Migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head          # apply all migrations
alembic upgrade head --sql    # preview the DDL without needing a live DB (offline mode)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"   # generate a new migration from model changes
```

The first migration (`create catalog schema`) was authored by autogenerating against a throwaway
scratch SQLite DB and then hand-verified by rendering it as real Postgres DDL via
`alembic upgrade head --sql` — the emitted `op.create_table` calls use the actual model
Column/type objects, so they compile correctly for whichever dialect `DATABASE_URL` points at.
Since SQLite became the actual default (not just an authoring scratch DB), three spots needed
dialect-aware handling rather than being left Postgres-only, all verified with a real
`alembic upgrade head` → `downgrade base` → `upgrade head` round trip against SQLite directly (not
just `--sql` rendering):
- Every model's primary key uses `app/db/base.py`'s `BigIntPK` instead of bare `BigInteger` -
  SQLite only auto-increments a PK when the column type is exactly `INTEGER`, so a bare
  `BigInteger` PK (which is fine on Postgres/`BIGSERIAL`) silently never autoincrements on SQLite.
- The `prices` table's partial unique index needs both `postgresql_where` and `sqlite_where` - the
  Postgres dialect happens to accept a plain string for the former, but SQLite's DDL compiler
  requires an actual `text(...)` expression for the latter.
- Postgres native enum types (created implicitly, one per `Enum` column) aren't dropped by the
  generated `downgrade()`, which breaks a downgrade-then-upgrade round trip - fixed with a
  `DROP TYPE` loop, guarded to run only on `dialect.name == "postgresql"` since SQLite has no
  native enum type at all (`Enum` renders as plain `VARCHAR`, with no DB-level CHECK either -
  SQLAlchemy's `Enum` defaults to `create_constraint=False` - so validity is enforced by
  Pydantic/the ORM layer, not the DB, on SQLite) - see the bottom of
  `alembic/versions/6579b05df670_create_catalog_schema.py`. `alembic/versions/e49d32df7bd1_*.py`
  (adding the `hybrid` fuel type) is a second example of the same postgres/sqlite split, this time
  via `batch_alter_table` on the SQLite side (SQLite can't redefine a column's type in place).

## Known gaps (see doc/api-contract.md "open items" for the full list)

- Conversation state is in-memory only (`app/services/conversation.py`) - no persistence, no
  multi-process support. There are no `conversations`/`messages` tables in the DB schema yet.
- `min_seats` is accepted by `StructuredRequirements` and the `/api/vehicles` query params but
  isn't actually filterable - no source document states seat count.
- The recommendation engine's budget handling is a hard filter; the design concept's "include a
  slightly-over-budget car with a warning flag" behavior isn't implemented (`flag` is always null).
- `scripts/import_scraper_data.py` never populates `option_items`/`option_availability` (equipment)
  - the scraper's source data has no surcharge amount, which the schema requires for `optional`
    rows - so `standard_equipment`/`optional_equipment` are empty for every scraper-imported vehicle.
