        Two sources, same reveal mechanism (`append_car_cards`, see below):

        - Browsing mode fetches the next page from the backend
          (`catalog_state.load_more`) - its own `is_loading_more`/
          `has_more` guard (see app/ui/state.py) is what actually prevents
          duplicate/overlapping fetches, since scroll events arrive as a
          burst of separate async tasks but each one's guard check runs
          synchronously before any `await`, so only the first of a burst
          ever gets past it.
        - Narrowed (AI/wizard) mode already has every match in memory
          (`conv.cars` - see `RecommendationEngine.recommend`'s own
          docstring for why it's no longer capped at 10) - "loading more"
          here just raises `narrowed_paging.shown` and reveals the next
          slice, no backend call needed.

        Either way, the newly-revealed cars are appended into the existing
        grid container (`append_car_cards`) rather than going through a
        full `results_body.refresh()` - refreshing would re-render every
        card accumulated so far, not just the new ones, and once enough
        pile up that single re-render's message exceeds NiceGUI's ~1MB
        websocket limit and disconnects the client (exactly the failure
        mode a large budget-only match set would otherwise hit).
        `results_body.refresh()` is still used as a fallback for the
        "Moje pořadí" custom-sort grid, whose drag handling is only wired
        up once per full render (see `results_grid`/`append_car_cards`'s
        docstrings) - the header (title/sort/filters) never needs it here,
