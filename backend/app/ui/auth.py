"""Login state for one browser connection: who is logged in, and the
request-code / verify-code / logout actions the login dialog drives.

A login is just two keys in NiceGUI's `app.storage.user` (the server-side
per-browser store behind the signed session cookie - see
`NICEGUI_STORAGE_SECRET` in `app/core/config.py`): the user id and when it
was issued. Nothing else about the user is cached there. `refresh()`
re-reads the user from the DB on every page load, so deactivating or
demoting an account takes effect on the next load, and a session older than
`AUTH_SESSION_DAYS` is dropped server-side no matter what the cookie says.

Who may do what is decided from `AuthState` (`is_admin`), never from what
the page happens to render: hiding a button is cosmetic, since a browser
can send any event over the websocket to any element that exists on its
page. Admin-only pages therefore refuse to build the privileged elements at
all for non-admins (see `app/ui/admin.py`), and handlers that don't have
that option re-check (see `app/ui/components/api_key_dialog.py`).
