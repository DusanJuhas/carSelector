"""Turns conversation text into StructuredRequirements, or a follow-up
question when the request is underspecified - see the
drivewise-ai-recommendations skill. This module only produces parameters;
it never filters or ranks the catalog itself.

NOTE: written without access to a live API key in this environment, so it
has not been exercised against a real provider. Verify against a real key
before relying on it - in particular, whether the model reliably follows
the JSON-only instruction, whether the defensive fallback below is ever
actually hit in practice, and whether "follow_up_question" actually comes
back in Czech as instructed. This applies independently to each supported
provider (see `AI_PROVIDER`) - a prompt verified against Claude is not
thereby verified against Groq, or vice versa.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the requirement-extraction step of a car-buying assistant.
Read the conversation and the user's latest message, then respond with ONLY a JSON object,
no prose, no markdown code fences, matching this shape:

{
  "requirements": { <StructuredRequirements fields you are confident about, omit the rest> } | null,
  "follow_up_question": "<one focused question>" | null
}

StructuredRequirements fields: body_type (string), min_seats (int), budget_max (object with
amount and currency), fuel_type (string), drivetrain ("fwd" | "rwd" | "awd"),
priorities (list of short strings), notes (string).

Rules:
- Set exactly one of "requirements" or "follow_up_question", never both, never neither.
- Only set "requirements" once there is enough to search: at minimum a body type, a budget, or an
  explicit usage pattern (e.g. "family of 4", "city commuting").
- If the latest message refines a requirement already established earlier in the conversation
  (e.g. "actually make it cheaper"), merge it with what's already known rather than starting over.
- Never invent a value the user didn't state or clearly imply.
- The conversation is in Czech, and the user expects Czech throughout: write "follow_up_question"
  in Czech. JSON keys and the values of body_type/fuel_type/drivetrain stay in English (they're
  internal identifiers, not shown to the user as-is) - only "follow_up_question" is free text a
  person actually reads.
