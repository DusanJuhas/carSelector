"""Passwordless login: a 6-digit one-time code sent by email.

Flow: `AuthService.request_code` emails a code; `AuthService.verify_code`
checks it and returns the user, creating the account on first login (there
is no separate signup - any email may create a regular account; admin
rights come only from `ADMIN_EMAILS` or another admin, see
`app/core/config.py`).

Codes are stored only as an HMAC (`app/core/config.py`'s `AUTH_SECRET`), are
single-use, expire after `LOGIN_CODE_TTL_MINUTES`, are burned after
`LOGIN_CODE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` wrong guesses (a 6-digit code is only 10^6
possibilities, so the attempt cap is what actually protects it), and
requesting a new code invalidates any earlier one for that address.

Timestamps are always UTC-aware when written and compared in SQL, never in
Python after a read: SQLite hands `DateTime(timezone=True)` columns back
naive, Postgres hands them back aware, and a Python-side comparison would
break on one of them.
