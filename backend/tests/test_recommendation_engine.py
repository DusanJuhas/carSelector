"""Regression test for a candidate-pool truncation bug: `recommend()` used
to cap `catalog.list_vehicles` at page_size=100 with no explicit `sort`,
which defaults to `configuration.id` ascending. Since ids are assigned in
scrape/import order, a budget filter narrow enough to leave >=100 matches
from whichever brand was imported first (Škoda, in production - see
`RecommendationEngine.CANDIDATE_POOL_SIZE`'s own comment) silently excluded
every other brand from scoring entirely, no matter how well - or how much
more cheaply - they'd have matched. Reproduced here with a synthetic
catalog: brand "AAA" gets the low ids (inserted first, like Škoda always
being scraped/imported first in production) but is pricier than brand
"ZZZ" (inserted second, higher ids) - the exact shape that broke."""
